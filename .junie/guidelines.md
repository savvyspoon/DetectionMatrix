# RiskMatrix Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
RiskMatrix is a Go-based application designed to help assess, visualize, and manage risks in various contexts. The project is currently in its early development stages with only the Go module definition set up.

## Project Structure
* The project is organized as a Go module named `riskmatrix`
* Go version 1.24 is used for development
* Source code will be organized following standard Go project layout:
  * `/cmd` - Main applications
  * `/pkg` - Library code that can be used by external applications
  * `/internal` - Private application and library code
  * `/api` - API definitions and documentation
  * `/web` - Web assets if applicable
  * `/configs` - Configuration file templates or default configs
  * `/docs` - Design and user documentation

## Development Guidelines
* Follow standard Go coding conventions and idioms
* Use Go modules for dependency management
* Write unit tests for all packages
* Document all exported functions, types, and constants
* Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Testing
* Write tests for all new functionality
* Run tests before submitting changes with `go test ./...`
* Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality

## Building
* The project can be built using standard Go tools: `go build ./...`
* Before submitting changes, ensure the project builds without errors

## Code Style
* Follow the official Go style guide
* Use `gofmt` or `goimports` to format code
* Keep line length reasonable (under 100 characters when possible)
* Use meaningful variable and function names

## Web Development Guidelines
* Use standard library packages (`net/http`, `html/template`, etc.) whenever possible
* Avoid using third-party web frameworks (like Gin, Echo, or Fiber)
* Implement proper middleware chains for common functionality (logging, authentication, etc.)
* Follow RESTful API design principles
* Use proper HTTP status codes and content types
* Implement appropriate error handling and logging for web requests
* Consider security best practices (HTTPS, input validation, CSRF protection, etc.)

## Frontend Development Guidelines
* Minimize JavaScript usage and dependencies to keep the application lightweight
* For interactive elements, prefer the following libraries:
  * HTMX for AJAX, CSS transitions, and DOM updates without writing JavaScript
  * Alpine.js for lightweight component-based interactivity when needed
  * Chart.js for data visualization and interactive charts
  * Vanilla JavaScript for simple DOM manipulations
* Avoid heavy frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) unless absolutely necessary
* Use progressive enhancement to ensure functionality for users with JavaScript disabled
* Implement responsive design to support various device sizes and orientations

## Frontend Style Guide
* HTML Structure:
  * Use semantic HTML5 elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
  * Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
  * Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
* CSS Guidelines:
  * Use a simple, consistent naming convention (BEM recommended)
  * Implement a color system with variables for consistency
  * Define a typography system with limited font families and sizes
  * Create reusable utility classes for common patterns
  * Organize CSS with a mobile-first approach
* JavaScript Style:
  * Write clean, modular JavaScript following modern ES6+ practices
  * Use event delegation for handling multiple similar elements
  * Implement proper error handling for all asynchronous operations
  * Document complex functions and components
* Performance Considerations:
  * Optimize images and assets for web delivery
  * Minimize HTTP requests by bundling assets when appropriate
  * Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
  * Consider using CSS for animations instead of JavaScript when possible

## MITRE ATT&CK Matrix Page Guidelines

### 1. Layout & Grid System
* Grid Layout: Use a horizontal grid where each column represents a Tactic.
* Responsive Design:
  * Desktop: Full-width grid with fixed-height tactic headers and scrollable technique lists.
  * Tablet: Collapse sub-techniques under parent technique in an accordion-style UI.
  * Mobile: Convert grid to stacked accordion view with collapsible tactic sections.
* Fixed Header: Keep the matrix title and tactic headers pinned during vertical scroll.
* Scrollbars:
  * Enable horizontal scroll for full matrix view on smaller screens.
  * Preserve scroll position when returning from a detail view.

### 2. Color & Visual Hierarchy
* Tactic Headers:
  * Background: Dark gray or navy blue
  * Text: White, bold, small-caps or uppercase

* Enrichment Score: Does detection provide context (host, user, process)?
* Actionability Score: Does it link to a playbook?

Efficacy displayed visually on detection dashboard using a compact bar or radar chart.

### 7. Lifecycle Mapping

Detection development follows the [Detection Development Lifecycle (DDL)](https://medium.com/snowflake/detection-development-lifecycle-af166fffb3bc):

| Stage      | Description                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Relationships Summary

* A **detection** can map to multiple **MITRE techniques** and **data sources**
* A **detection** generates multiple **events**
* Each **event** is linked to a **risk object** (user, host, IP) and possibly marked as a **false positive**
* **Risk alerts** are generated per **risk object** once cumulative score exceeds a threshold
